# Mongo Playground

**Mongo Playground** is a command-line tool that lets you write & test native mongosh commands in a file & execute it.  
It auto-reloads the file after each input, so you can experiment with MongoDB queries quickly ‚Äî no repetitive typing, no copy-pasting, no history scrolling.

Perfect for students, instructors & developers who work with MongoDB & want a persistent, testable query environment.

## üöÄ How to Use

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Install Mongo Playground

1. Download the `.msi` installer from the [Releases](#) section of this repository.  
2. Run the installer ‚Äî it will:
   - Install Mongo Playground
   - Add its path to your system environment variables (so you can run it from anywhere using the `mp` command)

> ‚úÖ **Note:** Make sure MongoDB Shell (mongosh) is installed & available in your system's PATH.

### üîê 2. Setup Environment Variables

A `.env` file is already included; **please replace the values below with your own MongoDB connection info**:

```env
CLUSTER_LINK=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net
DB_NAME=Practice # Optional
```
---

### üìÇ 3. Prepare Your Query File

Create a file (e.g. `query`) & write native mongosh commands in it:

```js
// switch database;
use myDatabase;

// create a collection;
db.createCollection("users");

// insert a document;
db.users.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 30 });

// find users;
db.users.find();
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Add a semicolon (;) after every query ‚Äî including after comments.  
> If a comment line does not end with a semicolon, the next query will be ignored or treated as part of the comment.

Open a terminal & run:

```cmd
mp --file path\to\query
