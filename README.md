# Mongo Playground

**Mongo Playground** is a command-line tool that lets you write & test native `mongosh` commands in a file with instant feedback. It auto-reloads the file after each input, so you can experiment with MongoDB queries quickly — no repetitive typing, no copy-pasting, no history scrolling.
